       <h1>Crazy Career Chronicles</h1>
       <h2>College When I was Still Colleged-Aged</h2>
            <p>I began my college education at Truman University, or as it was called then, "Northease Missouri State University."
                I was majoring in pre-med/chemistry, but that didn't last long. Chemistry required Calculus 1-3, but after Calc II, I decided to change
                my major to something with less math.  Also, Kirksville, MO is a lot colder than St. Louis, and I wanted to move someplace warmer, so I transfered to the University of South
                Florida and majored in accounting. During my first year there, I took a computer science class and liked it, so I changed my major to Computer Science. 
                Florida was beautiful and fun, but was homesick, so I moved back to St. Louis and took classes at UMSL.
            </p>
        <h2>My Third Major in Two Years! </h2>
            <p>Computer science at UMSL was quite the challenge. The year was 1996, and the title "Computer Programmer" was just becoming a main-stream job. People were signing up for 
                e-mail addresses on AOL, and companies like Amazon and Ebay were brand-new.  My opinion of my programming classes was that you needed to know how to program before taking
                the class. And I did not. Thus began my journey at St. Charles Community College....</p>
        <h2>SCCCC ("Scuh")</h2>
            <p>St. Charles Community College had a programming languages certificate, so I signed up for the program. 
                The classes were much easier than the UMSL programming classes. I learned a lot about basic programming and earned
                the certificate. I learned so much, in fact, that I was able to go back to UMSL and do pretty well in the CS classes. Some of the 
                classes were still really difficult, like "Operating Systems," where we had to create our own operating system, or 
                "Programming Languages," where we had to write our own programming language. I would say that progrmaming classes in the 90's
                were very hard-core compared to today. I feel like the classes were so difficult that the students didn't really learn a lot.
                For example, I had a class where the entire grade was two exams. Everyone failed both exams but received a grade of "B". Eventually, I was able to 
                graduate with a Bachelor's degree from UMSL in Liberal Studies - Chemistry and Computer Science (a Panera You Pick 2 degree).</p>
        <h2>Document Programming...and a Bunch of Other Stuff....</h2>
            <p>During my previous stint as a SCCC students, I had landed a job as a document programmer with a company called TALX.  
                The programming consisted of pulling processed data into a form and using programming to choose which data is displayed on benefits enrollment worksheets.
                It was kind of like a glorified mail merge with benefits enrollment information that was custom to each employee. At some point, some TALX customers had wanted
                their employees to be able to enroll in benefits online. This was circa 1999. I had learned some HTML while doing a project in a technical writing class, 
                of all things!  I volunteered to work on the websites. I made a few benefits enrollment websites using HTML and Javascript (CSS wasn't a thing yet), and employees were ablt to see 
                their custom choices and enroll in their plans. I was given a promotion to Applications Programmer and also began using something (I don't remember what) to format output data files (carrier files) so that 
                employee benefit selections could be sent to the insurance carriers.  
            </p>
        <h2>Baby, Baby, Baby</h2>
            <p>I eventually got married and was pregnant with my first child in 2002 (and later two more). I decided to stay home with him and I quit my programming job. Do I regret quitting? Not for a minute. I wouldn't trade my time with my children
                for the whole world. That being said, this isn't really about the kids, so I will move on!
