                        <p id="blackParagraph">I began my college education at
                            <a href="https://www.truman.edu">Truman University</a>, or as it was called then, "Northeast Missouri State University."
                                                                                                        I was majoring in pre-med/chemistry, but that didn't last long. Chemistry required Calculus 1-3, but after Calc II, I decided to change

                            <a href="https://www.stlouis-mo.gov/">St. Louis</a>, and I wanted to move someplace warmer, so I transfered to the University of South
                            <a href="https://www.usf.edu/">The University of South Florida</a>
                            &#38; majored in accounting. During my first year there, I took a computer science class and liked it, so I changed my major to Computer Science. 
                                                                                            Florida was beautiful and fun, but was homesick, so I moved back to St. Louis &#38; took classes at

                        <p id="greenParagraph">Computer science at UMSL was quite the challenge. The year was 1996, &#38; the title "Computer Programmer" was just becoming a main-stream job. People were signing up for 
                                                                                            e-mail addresses on AOL, and companies like Amazon &#38; Ebay were brand-new.  My opinion of my programming classes was that you needed to know how 
                                                                                            to program before taking

                        <p id="blackParagraph">St. Charles Community College had a programming languages certificate, so I signed up for the program. 
                                                                                            The classes were much easier than the UMSL programming classes. I learned a lot about basic programming and earned

                                                                                            "Programming Languages," where we had to write our own programming language. I would say that progrmaming classes in the 90's

                                                                                            For example, I had a class where the entire grade was two exams. Everyone failed both exams but received a grade of "B". Eventually, I was able to

                        <p id="greenParagraph">During my previous stint as a SCCC students, I had landed a job as a document programmer with a company called TALX.  
                                                                                            The programming consisted of pulling processed data into a form and using programming to choose which data is displayed on benefits enrollment worksheets.
                                                                                            It was kind of like a glorified mail merge with benefits enrollment information that was custom to each employee. At some point, some TALX customers had wanted

                                                                                            volunteered to work on the websites. I made a few benefits enrollment websites using HTML and Javascript (CSS wasn't a thing yet), and employees were able to see 
                                                                                            their custom choices and enroll in their plans. I was given a promotion to Applications Programmer and also began using something (I don't remember what) to format

                <p id="greenParagraph">Somewhere around 2010, my youngest was nearing kindergarten age, and I started thinking about going back to work. I looked at listings for programmers and saw a lot of acronyms that I had never 
                                    heard of. What the heck is Ruby on Rails???  I decided that I was obsolete as a programmer. I remembered my experience with UMSL computer programming classes (PTSD), and I thought maybe I should do something else. 
                                                                    Maybe (definitely) I watched too many episodes of CSI, but I decided that a job

    <p id="blackeParagraph">I landed a job in a food microbiology lab at a company called <a href="https://www.biomerieux.com">bioMerieux</a> in Hazelwood, MO. I was in charge of validating new PCR tests that they were developing. My dream of doing PCR all day had come true. 
                I really enjoyed it - even though it was stinky (bacteria incubating in raw shrimp plus a broth
                                        for a few days doesn't smell good!)  It was a very interesting job. However, the incubabion times were 6 hours, 12 hours, 18 hours, 24 hrs, etc. This was in addition to set up and sampling 
                                        /PCR testing. This made for an extremely long day. Bacteria grows when in wants and there is no "I'm going to go home now. Stop growing for 10 hours." My kids had been used to be being home A LOT, and 
                                        it wasn't working out that I was never home.  So I quit my awesome job. Again. (My kids are totally worth it, though!!!)</p>

    <p id="greenParagraph">Since I was now unemployed and had private school tuition to pay, I started subbing at my kids' school. 
                                        This allowed me to work and still spend time with my kids. I decided to increase my salary by getting some teaching certifications in math, science and computer science. I got a job at a school in Creve Coeur, which
                                        is very close to my boys' high school, so that is nice. I ended up taking more classes and getting my Masters in Science Education from <a href="https://www.UTA.edu">The University of Texas</a> this past

    <h2 class="headingFont">The Future</h2>
    <p id="greenParagraph">I applied for <a href="https://www.launchcode.com">Launchcode</a> on a whim, while looking for something to do to increase my salary. I wasn't sure if I had the time to commit to another program, but 
                                        I couldn't let the opportunity go by. Now that I am doing the programming assignments, I really love coding and am enjoying it. Coding is much more fun now than it was 20 years ago because when I get
                                        stuck, there is usually an online resource that I can use to figure things out. I am hoping to find employment in coding now that my kids are older and less dependent on me. Also, this might help pay for my 
                                        kids' college. My son was recently admitted to WashU and it is a bit stressful trying to figure out how I am going to pay for it along with my other 2 kid's high school tuition. I think a job in coding would be something that
                                    would solve that problem while doing something that I really enjoy.
